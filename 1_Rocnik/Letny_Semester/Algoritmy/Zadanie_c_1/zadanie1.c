//Zadanie 1 is sorting algorithm related
//in assignment, there is explicitly said to use structures, but I don't think it's a necessary.
//If I will find a way how to move entire lines of text within the file - I won't have to create nth structures
//I will save nth times of memory
//Algorithm that will be used - Radix
//Todo - find if it's a possible to move lines of code within the file - so I won't have to use structure
